Consider a simple series circuit with a DC power source and two resistors, as shown below, \textbf{assuming the passive convention}:

\begin{figure}[ht]

          to[R, l=$R_1$, v=$V_1$] (2,2)
          to[R, l=$R_2$, v=$V_2$] (4,2)
          -- (4,0) -- (0,0);
  \end{circuitikz}
  \caption{Series circuit with a DC power source and two resistors}
\end{figure}

Given the values:

\begin{itemize}
\item Voltage of the power source, $V_g = 12V$
\item Resistance of the first resistor, $R_1 = 2\Omega$
\item Resistance of the second resistor, $R_2 = 3\Omega$
\item Current through the circuit, $i_g = 2A$
\end{itemize}

We can calculate the voltage across each resistor using \textbf{Ohm's law}, $V = i \cdot R$:

\begin{align}
V_1 &= i_g \cdot R_1 = 2A \cdot 2\Omega = 4V \\
V_2 &= i_g \cdot R_2 = 2A \cdot 3\Omega = 6V
\end{align}

Now we can apply \textbf{KVL} in the direction of the current (from $+$ to $-$):

\begin{equation}
V_g - V_1 - V_2 = 0
\end{equation}

Substituting the given values:

\begin{equation}
12V - 4V - 6V = 2V \neq 0
\end{equation}

\textbf{This is not consistent with KVL}. The issue here is that the current $i_g$ is not correct. The current through the circuit should be equal to the voltage of the power source divided by the total resistance of the circuit, according to Ohm's law. So, the correct current is:

\begin{equation}
i_g = \frac{V_g}{R_1 + R_2} = \frac{12V}{2\Omega + 3\Omega} = 2.4A
\end{equation}

Substituting this current into the voltages across the resistors:

\begin{align}
V_1 &= i_g \cdot R_1 = 2.4A \cdot 2\Omega = 4.8V \\
V_2 &= i_g \cdot R_2 = 2.4A \cdot 3\Omega = 7.2V
\end{align}

Substituting these voltages into the KVL equation:

\begin{equation}
12V - 4.8V - 7.2V = 0V
\end{equation}

\textbf{Now, the sum of the voltages around the loop is equal to zero, which is consistent with KVL}. So, the direction of the loop does not affect the application of KVL, as long as we follow the passive sign convention and use the correct current.
